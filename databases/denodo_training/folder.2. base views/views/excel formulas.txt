Manual Email suppressions and title suppressions via excel:

=if(countif(range,cell you want to match in)>0,1,0)     -- I put a 1 to show as a match, since it is easy to sum up the ones and see how many matches there are.  You can change the 1 and 0 values to True and False if you wish.
